- Telecom Churn Prediction using classification algorithm like logistics regression, adaboost, gradient booost, random forest, decision tree, and XG Bosst with Grid Search cross valiadtion and Principal Component Analysis. 

Finding significant predictors for customer churn.
- Find how customer are getting churn with their consumer behaviour.
- Finding best features with which we can  predict customer churn and and detect parameters to retain high value customers.
